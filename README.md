Hot or Cold App Challenge


For this lesson, use your knowledge of functions and jQuery to build a "Hot or Cold" game. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess â€“ "hot" if their guess was close, and "cold" if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they'll have the option to start a new game.

In addition, learn how to work collaboratively by working with existing HTML and CSS codes. *Starter files are from previous Thinkful student, Jeya Karthika.
